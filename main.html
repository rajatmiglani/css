  			It isn’t found in a lap time. Or a 0–100 number. Or even on a price tag. It’s built on an obsession to detail. And a radical belief that a real supercar delivers performance in real-world conditions. Anywhere. Anytime. So refined, anyone can drive it. Yet so capable, in the right hands it can turn the automotive world on its ear. The Nissan GT-R. Its history speaks of world-beating performance, but the pursuit will always be of pure exhilaration.

  		Many believe that a supercar should only be driven on a perfect day, on a perfect stretch of road, and only by an expert driver. We have a different vision. That every day should be a supercar day. That you should be able to enjoy exhilaration with comfort and confidence, regardless of your skill level, on any road, regardless of conditions. A radical idea? Perhaps. But we like going our own way.

  			<b>570 PS 3.8-LITRE, TWIN-TURBO V6</b><br><br>
  			At the heart of the GT-R is an ideally sized, twin-turbocharged 3.8-L   V6 that produces a prodigious 570 ps and equally immense 637 nm of torque. Hand-assembled by one of only five master craftsmen in the world allowed to create such a masterpiece. But it’s more than just exceptional skill that goes into the process that makes the GT-R so special. As one of the craftsmen says, “We put our souls into each engine, hoping to deliver that excitement to customers.”

  			<b>HAND-CRAFTED TITANIUM EXHAUST</b><br><br>
  			Another example of the precision crafting of the GT-R. To ensure the proper cooling from the engine’s massive output, an available titanium exhaust is now offered. Notoriously difficult to work with, each exhaust is hand-built by Takumi, a master craftsman, and is specifically designed for an individual vehicle. Combined with an exotic sounding exhaust note, it’s music to any enthusiast’s ears.
